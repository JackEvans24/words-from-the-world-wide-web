# Words from the World Wide Web
A small program built for an art project which retrieves random words from random google searches.

The program uses Selenium to open up Chrome, go to Google, search for a word and then grab a random word from one of the site descriptions. Selenium closes the browser and the process starts again, until the user tells the program to stop.

This repository also contains a WordClassBuilder solution which is used to create the library of words to search on.
